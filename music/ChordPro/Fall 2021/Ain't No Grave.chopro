{t: Ainâ€™t No Grave}
{st: By Claude Ely; performed by Johnny Cash}

[Dm] Ain't no [G] grave
Can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave
Can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down

[Dm] When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm gonna [Dsus2] rise right out of the [Dm] ground
Ain't no [G] grave
Can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down

[Dm] Well, look way down the [Dsus2] river
And [Dm] what do you think I [Dsus2] see
I [Dm] see a band of [Dsus2] angels
And they're [Dm] coming after [Dsus2] me

[Dm] Ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down

[Dm] Well, look down yonder, [Dsus2] Gabriel
Put your [Dm] feet on the land and [Dsus2] sea
But [Dm] Gabriel, don't you [Dsus2] blow your trumpet
Un-[Dm]til you hear from [Dsus2] me

[Dm] Ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down

[Dm] [Dsus2]    x5
[Dm] [G] [Am] [Dm]    x2

[Dm] Well meet me, Jesus, meet [Dsus2] me
[Dm] Meet me in the middle of the [Dsus2] air
And [Dm] if these wings don't [Dsus2] fail me,
[Dm] I will meet you any-[Dsus2]where

[Dm] Ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down

[Dm] Well meet me, Mother and [Dsus2] Father,
[Dm] Meet me down the river [Dsus2] road
And [Dm] Mama, you know that [Dsus2] I'll be there
[Dm] When I check in my [Dsus2] load

[Dm] Ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm] There ain't no [G] grave can [Am] hold my body [Dm] down
[Dm]
