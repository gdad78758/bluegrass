Whistle 2x [C], [Dm], [F],  [C]

[C] Here’s a little song I wrote,  [Dm] and you can learn it note for note,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

In every life we have some trouble,
[Dm] when you worry you make it double,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

Ooh’s 2x [C] [Dm] [F]  [C]

[C] Aint got no place to lay your head,  [Dm] somebody came and took your bed,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

The Landlord say your rent is late,  [Dm] he may have to litigate,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

Whistle 2x  [C] [Dm] [F]  [C]

[C] Aint got no cash, aint got no style,  [Dm] aint got no goal to make you smile,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

Cos when you worry, your face will frown,  [Dm] and that will bring everybody down,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

Ooh’s 2x [C] [Dm] [F]  [C]

[C] Here’s a little song I wrote,  [Dm] and you can learn it note for note,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

In your life expect some trouble,  [Dm] but when you worry you make it double,
Don’t [F] worry, be [C] happy

Whistle fade over 3x [C] [Dm] [F]  [C]
