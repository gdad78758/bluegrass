BRIAN NOTES FROM KATY MEETING

Here are some notes I took after listening to all the recordings. I have edited the recordings to cut out the dead space and useless ramblings (by us, not Katy…) to make them more listenable length.

They are still large, so I will flood your inbox with multiple emails with one or two recordings per email.  PB note:  See Brian’s recordings attached to his 10-4-24 emails.  (Note also:  PB here is Paulette, not Paul)




Notes from SGB practice with Katy Cox October 2, 2024

Fills - 
Next step for our group is to get really intentful about fills
No boundaries (any and all instruments take fills)
Have a plan so not stepping on each other
“Rules”
Fills come during the long note at the end of a line of a verse 
If a break follows the verse, or follows a verse/chorus, the fills in the verse are played by the person who is going to take the break 


Harmony - 3 lines
Up or down a chord note from the melody


GRITS
Paulette come in on the chorus with spooky whoo whoo Banshee sound
Paulette sing along with everybody on last chorus to make it “humongo”
Intro, verse, verse, chorus, solo, verse, verse, chorus, solo, verse, chorus, outro (with spooky Paulette and spooky violin sound)

Angeline
Play a “line” 
intro line, verse, chorus, line, verse, chorus, solo, solo, verse, chorus, solo, solo, chorus, line out
Split the solos - one instrument A, another instrument B, otherwise song too long
A part Mandolin/B part Guitar
A part Fiddle/B part Guitar

Last Moonshiner
Intro with 3 part instrumental harmony
Guitar
Fiddle
Mandolin
