(Verse 1)
C                                 G
   Living' on the road my friend,  was gonna keep you free and clean
F                                       C                    G
 Now you wear your skin like iron, your  breath's as hard as  kerosene
F                                           C                F
 You weren't your mamma's only boy, but her  favorite one it  seems
    Am                    F    C    G
She began to cry when you said good-bye,
    F               Am
And  sank into your  dreams (2,3,4,1,2,3,*)

(Verse 2)
  GC                          G
 * Pancho was a bandit boys,  his horse was fast as polished steel
F                                       C               G
 He wore his gun outside his pants, for  all the honest  world to feel
F                                      C               F
 Pancho met his match you know, in the  desert down in  Mexico
    Am                F   C   G
And  no one heard his dy- ing words,
    F                  Am
But  that's the way it  goes (2,3,4,5,6,7,8)


F                          C                   F
 All the Federales say, we  could have had him  any day
Am               F    C   G           F               Am
 We only let him slip a-  way, out of  kindness I sup- pose (2,3,4,1,2,3,*)

(Verse 3)
  GC                               G
 * Lefty he can't sing the blues,  all night long like he used to
F                                     C            G
 The dust that Pancho bit down south,  ended up in  Lefty's mouth
F                                   C                F
 The day they laid poor Pancho low,  Lefty split for  Ohio
Am                F     C   G
 Where he got the bread to  go,
      F             Am
There  ain't nobody  knows (2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

F                          C                   F
 All the Federales say, we  could have had him  any day
Am               F    C   G           F               Am
 We only let him slip a-  way, out of  kindness I sup- pose (2,3,4,1,2,3,*)

(Verse 4)
  GC                                G
 * The poets tell how Pancho fell,  Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
F                                             C             G
 The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold, and  so the story  ends, we're told
F                                         C               F
 Pancho needs your prayers it's true, but  save a few for  Lefty too
Am                   F    C   G
 He only did what he had  to  do,
    F                 Am
And  now he's growing  old (2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

F                          C                   F
 A few grey Federales say,  could have had him  any day
Am               F     C   G           F               Am
 We only let him drift a-  way, out of  kindness I sup-pose (2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

F                          C                   F
 A few grey Federales say,  could have had him  any day
Am               F  C  G            F               Am
 We only let him go so long, out of  kindness I sup-pose (2,3,4,1,2,3,*)
