Written by Andrew Jenkins, 1922

[Introduction]

C G C

[Verse 1]
[C] A miner was [F] leaving his [C] home for his work
[C] When he heard his [D7] little child [G7] scream
He [C] went to the [F] side of the [C] little girl's bed
[C] She said, "Daddy, I've [G7] had such a [C] dream!"

[Chorus]
[C] Please Daddy don't [C7] go to the [F] mines to [C] day
[C] For dreams have so often come [G] true.
My [C] Daddy, my [F] daddy, please [C] don't go away,
[C] For I never could [G7] live without [C] you.

[Verse 2]
[C] Then smiling and [F] stroking the [C] little girl's face
[C] He was turning a [D7] way from her [G7] side
But [C] she threw her [F] small arms a [C] round daddy's neck
[C] She gave him a [G7] kiss, and then [C] cried: ...

[Verse 3]
[C] "Oh I dreamed that the [F] mines were all [C] flaming with fire
[C] And the men, all [D7] fought for their [G7] lives.
Just [C] then the scene [F] changed, and the [C] mouth of the mine
[C] Was covered with [G7] sweethearts and [C] wives."

[Chorus]
[C] "Oh daddy, don't [C7] go to the [F] mines to [C] day,
[C] For dreams have so often come [G] true.
My [C] Daddy, my [F] daddy, please [C] don't go away,
[C] For I never could [G7] live without [C] you."

[Verse 4]
[C] "Go down to the [F] village and [C] tell your dear friends
[C] That as sure as the [D7] bright stars do [G7] shine,
There is [C] something that's [F]going to [C] happen today;
[C] Please daddy, don't [G7] go to the [C] mines."

[Chorus]
[C] Oh Daddy don't [C7] work in the [F] mines to [C] day
[C] For dreams have so often come [G] true.
My [C] Daddy, my [F] daddy, please [C] don't go away,
[C] For I never could [G7] live without [C] you."
