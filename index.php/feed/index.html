<p><strong>O</strong>n June 14 of this year, the Tuesday Ukes lost the man we think of as the group&#8217;s founder and prime mover, Kevin Jay Jolly. He died of a heart attack, survived by his son Don and his wife Karen.<br><br>Among his passions were the Ural motorcycle and Texas archaeology, but most of us knew him for his love of the ukulele and sharing it with others. Soon after the Austin Ukulele Society was formed in 2011, Kevin decided along with some friends that it would be better to meet weekly instead of monthly, and the Tuesday Uke Group was formed. </p>



<p>Over the past few years, 12 to 18 people would gather to share songs and learn new ones. In 2019 and the first half of 2020, Kevin contacted senior facilities in the hopes of recruiting more ukulele players in Austin. During these sessions, Kevin and TUG members dropped by, for example, the Lamar Senior Center with his loaner ukuleles to share songs and to get people playing. The group also visited senior homes to offer the residents chances to sing familiar Country and Tin Pan Alley songs.<br><br>We will miss Kevin terribly, and his friends and TUG members have decided to do their best to keep the group going. Because of COVID-19, we still meet on Tuesdays at 7 pm, but we meet on the ZOOM software forum, with hopes of returning to live meetings soon&#8230; </p>



<p>Join us online! Get the details in our &#8220;Quarantine Edition&#8221; post. Hope we see you soon to continue Kevin&#8217;s legacy.<br><br></p>

<p>We all had a great time. Thanks to Michelle for the percussion, Walter on the Kazoo, and Bill on Bass &#8211; we sounded like a band! TUG is looking forward to the time (somewhere in the mysterious future) we&#8217;ll all be able to get together and participate in an open mic again!</p>

<p>TUG will be hosting two Uke Camps in September. This is a 4-week program for Seniors (50+)  new to the uke or wondering if the uke is something for them (the answer is yes!). We cover the basics:</p>



<ul><li>Parts of the ukulele</li><li>How to hold the ukulele</li><li>Fingering chords</li><li>How to learn new chords</li><li>Simple strumming</li><li>How to make more complex strums</li><li>How to learn a song on the uke</li><li>Strumming and singing </li><li>Reading TABS</li></ul>



<p>And we play songs &#8211; but the end of the camp you&#8217;ll be playing two and three chord songs confidently in a group. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have 10 loaner ukes available for the classes, and TUG has donated 5 ukuleles to each location so there will be ukuleles available outside of class for folks to practice and play. So no uke &#8211; no problem!</p>
