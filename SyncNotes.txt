How to sync everything:

- Make any changes in the bluegrass/links and bluegrass/music folders
- Add everything you don't want to be followed by git to the SyncWithMartyOffice folder
  on the Marty-Office computer
- use Visual Studio Code and make sure everything is up to date
- invoke syncblue.sh  - on the Marty-Office computer, use the windows ubuntu app which
                        will give you a linux like terminal on the windows machine.
						Then cd /mnt/c/git
						Then invoke the update script:   ./syncblue.sh
- This takes everything on the Marty-Office computer sends it to the RPi
- To update the RPi computer (69.5.217.253):
                        ssh into it:   ssh user@69.5.217.253
						within the home folder /home/marty invoke the shell script
						./update_bluegrass.sh
						Log out of the RPi computer - exit
- To update Linux-desktop (192.168.1.237) git tracked files:
                        ssh marty@192.168.1.237
                        In terminal for Linux-desktop cd ~/git/bluegrass
						sudo git status
						sudo git pull
						- Exit Linux-desktop
- To update Liv-Room (192.168.1.149) git tracked files:
                        ssh -p 2569 marty@192.168.1.149
                        In terminal for Liv-Room cd ~/git/bluegrass
						sudo git status
						sudo git pull
						- Exit Liv-Room

- Now update 'SyncWithMartyOffice' files that are not tracked by git:
                        Fire up FreeFileSync on Marty-Office computer
						Choose 'SyncLinuxDesktop'
						    On left side choose c:\git\bluegrass\SyncWithMartyOffice
							On right side choose 
							ftp://marty@192.168.1.237/home/marty/git/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice|pass64=Y2hpY28=
            				and do a 'Compare', then 'Synchronize'
					    Confirm sync by looking into /git/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice
						

                        Fire up FreeFileSync on Marty-Office computer
						Choose 'SyncLivRoom'
						    On left side choose c:\git\bluegrass\SyncWithMartyOffice
							On right side choose 
		                    ftp://marty@192.168.1.149/home/marty/git/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice|pass64=Y2hpY28=
            				and do a 'Compare', then 'Synchronize'
