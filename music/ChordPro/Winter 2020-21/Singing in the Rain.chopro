{t: Singing in the Rain}
{st: lyrics by Arthur Freed and music by Nacio Herb Brown, 1929}

I’m [F] singing in the rain, just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling I’m [C] happy again.
I’m [C] laughing at clouds, so dark up above
The sun’s in my heart and I’m [F] ready for love.
Let the [F] stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place.
Come on with the rain, I’ve a [C] smile on my face.
I’ll [C] walk down the lane with a happy refrain,
Just singing … singing in the [F] rain.
