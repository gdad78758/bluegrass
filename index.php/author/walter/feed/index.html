<p><strong>O</strong>n June 14 of this year, the Tuesday Ukes lost the man we think of as the group&#8217;s founder and prime mover, Kevin Jay Jolly. He died of a heart attack, survived by his son Don and his wife Karen.<br><br>Among his passions were the Ural motorcycle and Texas archaeology, but most of us knew him for his love of the ukulele and sharing it with others. Soon after the Austin Ukulele Society was formed in 2011, Kevin decided along with some friends that it would be better to meet weekly instead of monthly, and the Tuesday Uke Group was formed. </p>



<p>Over the past few years, 12 to 18 people would gather to share songs and learn new ones. In 2019 and the first half of 2020, Kevin contacted senior facilities in the hopes of recruiting more ukulele players in Austin. During these sessions, Kevin and TUG members dropped by, for example, the Lamar Senior Center with his loaner ukuleles to share songs and to get people playing. The group also visited senior homes to offer the residents chances to sing familiar Country and Tin Pan Alley songs.<br><br>We will miss Kevin terribly, and his friends and TUG members have decided to do their best to keep the group going. Because of COVID-19, we still meet on Tuesdays at 7 pm, but we meet on the ZOOM software forum, with hopes of returning to live meetings soon&#8230; </p>



<p>Join us online! Get the details in our &#8220;Quarantine Edition&#8221; post. Hope we see you soon to continue Kevin&#8217;s legacy.<br><br></p>

<p>So we will be meeting indefinitely on Tuesday evenings 7:00&#8211;9:00 on Zoom. </p>

<p>We used to email people invitations to our Zoom meetings, but since they don&#8217;t change, the instructions are below. We also capture the meetings on video &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://tuesdayukes.org/index.php/on-line-open-mic/" target="_blank">OnLine Open Mic Videos.</a></p>



<p>We also have play along videos  &#8211; check out the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://tuesdayukes.org/index.php/tug-member-videos/" target="_blank">Member Videos</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://tuesdayukes.org/index.php/spring-2020-songbook/" target="_blank">Spring 2020 Songbook videos. </a> And since we&#8217;re all pretty much sitting at home most of the time &#8211; this is a good chance to work on some new strums with our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://tuesdayukes.org/index.php/tug-strum-class/" target="_blank">TUG Strum Class videos</a>.  We&#8217;re adding videos (and other stuff) almost every day &#8211; so check back.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be updating our calendar with local online events &#8211; and check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukulelemag.com/stories/news/livestream-ukulele-online-events-calendar" target="_blank">Ukulele Magazine&#8217;s Live Stream Events Calendar</a> &#8211; lots of great stuff going on in the ukulele world. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong><a href=http://tuesdayukes.org/index.php/event/uke-along/>UkeAlong</a></strong>! <br>
No meeting at the Hancock Center on Tuesday, January 7. We're meeting at the Central Market, North Lamar. </p>
<hr>-->


<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-85 size-thumbnail" src="http://tuesdayukes.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_1271-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></h6>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re a group of uke players who wish we could meet each Tuesday at 7:00pm at The Hancock Recreation Center &#8211; 811 E. 41st Street, Austin, TX. (<a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/hancock-recreation-center">Hancock Rec Center Web</a>). It&#8217;ll happen again, we hope, and we&#8217;ll let you know when.</p>
<p>We open our meetings by playing a couple of songs that we haven&#8217;t played for a while. Then we play a few songs from our current, and ever-changing quarterly songbook. Folks bring in songs they like and we try new songs &#8211; we&#8217;re open to anything! We project the song sheets on the wall &#8211; and we have loaner ukes at every meeting &#8211; so you don&#8217;t need anything! At the end of each quarter we pull a dozen or so songs from our current songbook, print song sheets,&nbsp; and have an open uke jam at a local watering hole &#8211; we call it a UkeAlong.&nbsp; We take our loaner ukes and usually get some bystanders involved&nbsp; &#8211; it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>From 6:30pm to 7:00pm each Tuesday we have a gentle warm up where we play one and two-chord songs.</p>
<p>If you have any questions drop us an email &#8211; <strong>tug_info@tuesdayukes.org</strong>. We&#8217;re very informal, and this is a friendly group &#8211; so come out and play ukes with us.</p>
