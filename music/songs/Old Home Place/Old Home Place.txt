[Verse 1]
It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since[C] I left my [G]home
In the holler where I was b[D]orn
Where the [G]cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
And the fox hunter bl[D]ows his h[G]orn
 
I [G]fell in [B7]love with a [C]girl from the [G]town
I thought that she would be tr[D]ue
I [G]ran a[B7]way to [C]Charlottes[G]ville
And worked in a [D]sawmill or [G]two
 
[Chorus]
     [D]What have they done to the [G]old home place?
     [A7]Why did they tear it [D7]down?
     And [G]why did I [B7]leave my [C]plow in the [G]field?
     And look for a [D]job in the [G]town?

[Verse 2] 
Well, the [G] girl ran [B7] off with [C] somebody [G]else
The tariffs took all my [D] pay
And [G] here I [B7] stand where the [C] old home [G] stood
Before they [D] took it a[G] way
 
Now the [G] geese fly [B7] south and the [C] cold wind [G] blows
As I stand here and hang my [D] head
I've [G] lost my [B7] love, I've [C] lost my [G] home
And now I [D] wish that I was [G] dead
 
[Chorus]
     [D] What have they done to the [G] old home place?
     [A7] Why did they tear it [D7] down?
     And [G] why did I [B7] leave my [C] plow in the [G] field?
     And look for a [D] job in the [G] town?

     [A7] Why did they tear it [D7] down?

     And look for a [D] job in the [G] town?
