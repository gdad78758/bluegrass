CLINCH MOUNTAIN BACKSTEP 
By R. Stanley 
Arranged by Eddie Collins 

Notice how this tune avoids hitting the 4th fret C# note on the 2nd string. You will mordy we your 2nd and 3rd fingers as if playing out of a pentatonic blues scale. Your 3rd finger performs the 5 - 7 slides. The measure of 24 time adds an additional half measure of A before switching to the E chord in Part B
