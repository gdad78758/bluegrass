    Hello darkness my old friend
                           Dsus2
I've come to talk with you again
                     A#      F
Because a vision softly creeping
                       A#       F
Left his seeds while I was sleeping
        A#                            F
And the vision that was planted in my brain
               Dm   F            C        Dsus2
Still remain          within the sound of silence.


(Verse 1)

                             C
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Dm
Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   A#       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          A#       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        A#                                       F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                       Dm   F                 C        Dm
That split the night          and touched the sound of silence.


(Verse 2)

                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                          Dm
Ten thousand people maybe more

                   A#       F
People talking without speaking
                   A#        F
People hearing without listening
               A#                      F
People writing songs that voices never share
                  Dm   F             C        Dm
And no one dare          disturb the sound of silence


(Verse 3)

                        C
Fools said I you do not know
                      Dm
Silence like a cancer grows
                     A#          F
Hear my words that I might teach you
                    A#          F
Take my arms that I might reach you
       A#                          F
But my words like silent raindrops fell
Dm       F             C        Dm
     And echoed in the wells of silence


(Verse 4)

                         C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon god they made
         F                A#      F
And the sign flashed out its warning
                     A#      F
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said
    A#                                              F
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
                     Dm       F                C
And tenement halls        and whispered in the sounds of
Dsus2
silence
