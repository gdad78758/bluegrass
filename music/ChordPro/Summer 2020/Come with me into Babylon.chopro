{t: Come with Me into Babylon}
{st: W. Minkel}

[G] Come with [D7] me into [G] Babylon [G7]
Where [C] golden towers [Cm] shine all over [G] town [G7]
But sometimes [C] cobras [Cm] slither through the [G] pipes into the
[E7] bathrooms,
Be [A7] careful before you sit [D7] down

[G] Come with [D7] me into [G] Babylon [G7]
Where the [C] pigeons will [Cm] speak to you in [G] words [G7]
But [C] sometimes they will [Cm] whisper the [G] day you’re going to [E7] die,
So you [A7] might not want to [D7] talk to these [G] birds.

[C] Oh, what a [Cm] beautiful [G] morning [G7]
As [C] long as you [Cm] understand the [G] warning [G7]
I [C] know that you [Cm] know that [G] life is a [E7] gamble,
And in [A7] Babylon, you sometimes need to [D7] scramble

Oh [G] come with [D7] me into [G] Babylon [G7]
Meet our [C] king, filled with [Cm] wisdom from [G] afar [G7]
But if you [C] want to [Cm] live,
there are three words you [G] must not [E7] mention…
And [A7]no one will [D7] tell you what they [G]are!

{c: Instrumental break}
Oh [G]come with [D7]me into [G]Babylon [G7]
Where [C]elephants [Cm]take to the [G]skies [G7]
Pay [C] close at-[Cm] tention to the spot [G]where you are [E7] standing
So [A7] something big and green won’t land in your [D7] eyes [G] [G7]

[C]Oh, what a [Cm]beautiful [G]morning [G7]
As [C]long as you [Cm]understand the [G]warning [G7]
I [C]know that you [Cm]know that [G]life is a [E7]gamble,
And in [A7]Babylon, you [D7] sometimes need to [G]scramble. [D7] [G]
