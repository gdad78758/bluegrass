{t: I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas}
{st: John Rox; a big hit in 1953}

I [G] want a hippopotamus for Christmas. Only a hippopotamus will 	[D] do
Don't want a [D7] doll, no dinky Tinker Toy
I  [A] want a hippopotamus to [D7] play with and enjoy

I [G] want a hippopotamus for Christmas â€“ I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do [D] you?
He [D7] won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just [A] bring him through the front door, that's the [D7] easy thing to do

I can [G7] see me now on 	[C] Christmas morning,
[G7] creeping down the [C] stairs
Oh what [D7] joy and what surprise,	when I 	[G] open up my eyes
to see a [A7] hippo hero [D] standing [D7] there

I [G] want a hippopotamus for Christmas  - Only a hippopotamus will [D] do
[D7] Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then
[A] Teacher says a hippo is a [D7] vegetarian

I [G] want a hippopotamus for Christmas. Only a hippopotamus will 	[D] do
There's [D] lots of room for him in our two-car garage
I'd [A] feed him there and wash him there and  [D7] give him his massage
I can [G7] see me now on [C] Christmas morning,
[G7] creeping down the [C] stairs
Oh, what [D7] joy and [C] what surprise,	when I 	[G] open up my eyes
to see a [A7] hippo hero [D] standing [D7] there

I [G] want a hippopotamus for Christmas  - Only a hippopotamus will [D] do
[D7] No crocodiles or rhinoceroses
[A7] I only like [D7] hippopota- [A7] muses       And [D7] hippopota-muses like me [G] too!
