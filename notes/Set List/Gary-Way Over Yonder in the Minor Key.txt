  C                              F
I  lived in a place called Okfus--kee
F                                    C
 And I had a little girl in a holler tree
C                                   F
 I said, little girl, it's plain to see
F                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me

C                             F
 She said it's hard for me to see
F                          C
 How one little boy got so ugly
C                                  F
 I said my little girly that might be
F                                          Am
 But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me

F                             C
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                             Am
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                                      Am
 There ain't nobody that can sing like me
         G                                Am
No there  ain't nobody that can sing like me

C                              F
 We walked down by the Buckeye Creek
F                                   C
 To see the frog eat the goggle eye bee
C                                         F
 And to hear the west wind whistle to the east
F                                      Am
 There ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me

C                                   F
 Oh my little girly will you let me see
F                                     C
 Way over yonder where the wind blows free
C                               F
 Nobody gonna see in our holler tree
F                                          Am
 And there ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me

F                             C
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                             Am
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                                      Am
 There ain't nobody that can sing like me
         G                                Am
No there  ain't nobody that can sing like me

/ Way over yonder in the minor key
 G                             Am
/ Way over yonder in the minor key
 G                                      Am

C                                    F
 Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
F                           C
 And laid it on the she and me
C                                   F
 It stung lots worse than a hive of bees
F                                          Am
 But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me

C                              F
 Now I have walked a long long ways
F                                       C
 And I still look back to my tanglewood days
C                              F
 I've led others since then to stray
F                                       Am
 Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me
G                                Am
 Ain't nobody that can sing like me


F                             C
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                             Am
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                                      Am
 There ain't nobody that can sing like me

F                             C
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                             Am
 Way over yonder in the minor key
G                                      Am
 There ain't nobody that can sing like me
         G                                Am
No there  ain't nobody that can sing like me
