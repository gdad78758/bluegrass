(Verse 1 Marty sings)
[1] Well, when you’re down on your luck,
And you ain’t got a buck, in [5] London you’re a goner. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

Even [2m]London Bridge has [27]fallen down,
And [1] moved to Ari-zona, now I know [4] why. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And I’ll substantiate the rumor
That the English sense of humor, is [1] drier than than the Texas sand. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
You can [Em] put up your dukes, And you can [Cm] bet your boots; 
I’m [5] leavin’ just as fast as I can. (2,3,4,1,2)
 

(Chorus All sing)
 
I wanna go [4] home with the [Em] armadillo [2m]
Good country [4] music from Ama-[5]rillo and Abi-[1]lene
The friendliest [4] people and the prettiest [5] women you’ve ever [1] seen. 


(Verse 2 Larry sings)
[1]Well, it’s cold over here, and I swear
I [5] wish they’d turn the heat on (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And [2m]where in the world is that [27]English girl
I [1] promised I would meet ... on the third [4] floor. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And of the whole damn lot, the only friend I’ve got
Is a [1] smoke and a cheap guitar. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
My [Em] mind keeps roamin’, my [Cm] heart keeps longin’ 
To be [5] home in a Texas bar. (2,3,4,1,2) 

(Chorus All sing)
 
I wanna go [4] home with the [Em] armadillo [2m]
Good country [4] music from Ama-[5]rillo and Abi-[1]lene
The friendliest [4] people and the prettiest [5] women you’ve ever [1] seen.

(Verse 3 Paulette sings)

[1]Well, I decided that I’d get my cowboy hat
And [5] go down to Marble Arch Station. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

’Cause when a [2m]Texan fancies, he’ll [27]take his chances.
[1] Chances will be taken, that’s for [4] sure. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And them Limey eyes, they were eyein’ the prize
That some [1] people call manly footwear. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
And they said [Em] you’re from down South, and [Cm] when you open your mouth, 
You [5] always seem to put your foot there. (2,3,4,1,2)


(Chorus All sing)
 
I wanna go [4] home with the [Em] armadillo [2m]
Good country [4] music from Ama-[5]rillo and Abi-[1]lene
The friendliest [4] people and the prettiest [5] women you’ve ever [1] seen.

(Repeat chorus - until the cows come home)

I wanna go [4] home with the [Em] armadillo [2m]
Good country [4] music from Ama-[5]rillo and Abi-[1]lene
The friendliest [4] people and the prettiest [5] women you’ve ever [1] seen.
