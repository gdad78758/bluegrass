[Em] I'd rather be a sparrow than a [G] snail
Yes I would, if I could, I surely [Em] would
I'd rather be a hammer than a [G] nail
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely [Em] would


[C] Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a [G] swan that's here and gone
a [C] man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the [G]  world its saddest sound
It s saddest [Em] sound

[Em] I'd rather be a forest than a [G] street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely [Em] would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my [G] feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely [Em] would


[C] Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a [G] swan that's here and gone
a [C] man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the [G]  world its saddest sound
It s saddest [Em] sound
