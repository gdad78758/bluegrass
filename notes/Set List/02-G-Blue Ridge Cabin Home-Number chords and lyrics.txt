		  blue  ridge   hills far a -way
	Chorus
      Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
      From those Blueridge hills I did roam
      When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
      Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
		
  Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
  In those blue ridge hills far away
  Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
  They are sleeping in peace together there
		
  I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
  I've been longing for days gone by
  When I die won't your bury me on that old mountain side
  Make my resting place upon the hills so high
