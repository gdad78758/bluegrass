Hey Paul! Yes, it's fine to play that tune; it's very well-known, obviously, so it won't win points with the "cool kids" but we can and do play it regularly. In fact, I quite fancy a slightly different version of the tune that Shannon Heaton plays, which you can hear here:

Hi Ian 
 Is it okay to play the Irish Washerwoman at the session? I suspect it may be like Foggy Mountain Breakdown for bluegrass banjo players.

I will miss this Thursday because I'll be out of town.

Thank you
Paul Maine
