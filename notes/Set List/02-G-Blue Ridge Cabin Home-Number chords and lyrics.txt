Verse 1 - Paulette sings	
    [1]There's a well beaten path in the [4]old mountainside
    Where I [5]wandered when I was a[1] lad
    And I wandered alone to the [4]place I call home
    In those [5]Blue Ridge hills far[1] away
Chorus - All sing
        Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
        From those Blueridge hills I did roam
        When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
        Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
(Instrumental break)
Verse 2 - Paulette sings
    Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
    In those blue ridge hills far away
    Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
    They are sleeping in peace together there
Chorus - All sing
(Instrumental break)
Verse 3 - Paulette sings
    I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
    I've been longing for days gone by
    When I die won't your bury me on that old mountain side
    Make my resting place upon the hills so high
Chorus - All sing
(Instrumental break)
Chorus - All sing with tag line at end
