C G D G

[G] Mama wore one for years 
[D] wiped away our tears
[C] Used it to bring in apples
In the [G] fall of the [D] year
Carried [G] sweet corn that she grew
Made it [D] look a little used
But to [C] me there wasn't nothin'
Mama's [D] apron couldn't [G] do

Chorus:
They don't [C] use 'em quite as much [G] today
We [Em] sure could use 'em [A] to wipe some tears [D] away
I [C] sure do miss the comfort it could [G] bring 
'Cause my world was tied together with 
[D] Mama's apron [G] strings

[C] [G] [Em] [A] [D] [C] [G] [D] [G]

[G] The front pockets where she hid all the 
[D] treasures for us kids
thought it [C] might run out of stuff
But you [G] know it never [D] did
Now she's [G] with the Lord up there
But on the [D] nail by the stairs
It's [C] easy for me to see her
In that [D] apron hangin' [G] there

Chorus

[C] [G] [Gm] [D] [G]
