<p>Austin Ukulele Society hosted an open mic at Kick Butt Coffee on Saturday Feb 22 &#8211; and it was great! We played two songs &#8211; <em>Istanbul (not Constantinople)</em> and  <em>Swingin&#8217; on a Star</em>.  Here&#8217;s a couple of videos (you&#8217;ll probably need to turn up the volume to hear them well). </p>

<p>We all had a great time. Thanks to Michelle for the percussion, Walter on the Kazoo, and Bill on Bass &#8211; we sounded like a band! TUG is looking forward to the time (somewhere in the mysterious future) we&#8217;ll all be able to get together and participate in an open mic again!</p>

There is a new folder called &#8211; COMPILATIONS. This should be where you will find the Quarterly Song books &#8211; and other compilations of songs.

(This allows folks with OnSong on an iPad to load songs and sets). We haven&#8217;t updated the individual song files yet &#8211; but should have those up-to-date in the next few weeks. </p>

<p>We had a great time at the <a href="http://thebrewtorium.com/">Brewtorium</a> on April 2. We had more than 30 folks playing and singing  &#8211; and in addition to the ukes we had some great percussion, Kazoo, and harmonica playing. Thanks to the Brewtorium and everyone who came out. Our next Tuesday Ukealong will be July 2 at the Central Market on North Lamar. See you there!</p>
