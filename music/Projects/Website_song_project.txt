Question:
  - will the json file be kept?  Or is it discarded once Paul M. has pulled the info into
     the database?

Marty's naming convention proposal:

 - Each unique song gets a unique filename:
    "song_name_xx_yy"  with it's associated filetype, where xx is version of song, yy is key

   Each 'xx' is intended to separate songs of the same name from one another as well as
     major differences between artists

9/2/2020

 - Initial Zoom meeting:  Paul Butler, Paul Maine, Walter, Marty

  Major work item:  come up with content of the metadata and establish naming conventions
    for files.
================================
CURRENT STATE OF DECISIONS
================================
  
  File naming conventions:
    In general, the file name is "name_of_song_xx_yy".filename where
      1. name_of_song is the name of the song, but omitting any leading articles ('A', 'The', 
         or 'An')
      2. The first song in a series can either provide xx or leaves out '_xx'. For 
           example the first chordpro file of the song of "A Summer Song" in C would be either
           'summer_song_01_C.cho' or 'summer_song_C.cho'
      3. Second song with the same name is either a completely different song or the 
         same song but with enough changes to warrant a separate file and follows
         the format of 'name_of_song_02_yy'.filename.  Example: a second chordpro file of a song 
         called "A Summer Song" in the key of A would be 'summer_song_02_A.cho'
      4. ???? Do we want to allow for the case where the key is not provided?
