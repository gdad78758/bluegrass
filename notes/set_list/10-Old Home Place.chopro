(Intro - Brian)
/&blue:It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since [C]I left my [G]home
/&blue:In the hollow where I was [D]born
/&blue:Where the [G]cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
/&blue:And the foxhunter [D]blows his [G]horn

(Verse 1 - Dan sings)
It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since [C]I left my [G]home
In the hollow where I was [D]born
[G]Where the cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
And the foxhunter [D]blows his [G]horn

(Instrumental break 1 - Larry & Gary)
/&blue:It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since [C]I left my [G]home
/&blue:In the hollow where I was [D]born
/&blue:Where the [G]cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
/&blue:And the foxhunter [D]blows his [G]horn

(Verse 2 - Dan sings)
I [G]fell in [B7]love with a [C]girl from the [G]town
I thought that she would be [D]true
I [G]ran [B7]away to [C]Charlottes[G]ville
And worked in a [D]sawmill or [G]two

(Chorus -  All sing)
[D]What have they done to the [G]old home place
[A7]Why did they tear it [D]down
And [G]why did I [B7]leave the [C]plow in the [G]field
And look for a [D]job in the [G]town

(Instrumental break 2 - Brian & Marty)
/&blue:It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since [C]I left my [G]home
/&blue:In the hollow where I was [D]born
/&blue:Where the [G]cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
/&blue:And the foxhunter [D]blows his [G]horn

(Verse 3 - Dan sings)
Well my [G]girl she ran [B7]off with [C]somebody [G]else
The taverns took all my [D]pay
And [G]here I [B7]stand where the [C]old home [G]stood
Before they [D]took it [G]away

(Break 3 - Dan)
/&blue:It's been [G]ten long [B7]years since [C]I left my [G]home
/&blue:In the hollow where I was [D]born
/&blue:Where the [G]cool fall [B7]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
/&blue:And the foxhunter [D]blows his [G]horn

(Verse 4 - Dan sings)
Now the [G]geese they fly [B7]south and the [C]cold wind [G]blows
As I stand here and hang my [D]head
I've [G]lost my [B7]love I've [C]lost my [G]home
And now I [D]wish that I was [G]dead

(Chorus - All sing)
[D]What have they done to the [G]old home place
[A7]Why did they tear it [D]down
And [G]why did I [B7]leave the [C]plow in the [G]field
And look for a [D]job in the [G]town

(Outro- All sing)
And look for a [D]job in the [G]town
