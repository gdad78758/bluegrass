(Intro:)
[G]//// [Em]//// [C]////  [D]/   [C] / [Bm] / [Am] /


[G]Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the [D7]Christmas party hop.
[Am7]Mistletoe [D7]hung where [Am7]you can [D7]see; every [Am7]couple [D7]wants to [G]stop.

[G]Rockin' around the Christmas tree; let the [D7]Christmas spirit ring.
[Am7]Later we'll [D7]have some [Am7]pumpkin [D7]pie, and we'll [Am7]do some [D7]caro-[G]ling.

[C]You will get a sentimental [Bm]feeling, when you hear;
[Em]Voices singing,"[G]let's be jolly; [A7(stop)]deck the halls with [D7(stop)]boughs of holly".

[G]Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a [D7]happy holiday.
[Am7]Ev'ryone [D7]dancing [Am7]merri[D7]ly, in the [Am7]new old-[D7]fashioned [G]way.
