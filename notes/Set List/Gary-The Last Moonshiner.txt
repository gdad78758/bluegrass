(Intro riff (Gary-plays twice)

(Verse 1-Paulette)

Cm
They're buying a license
Eb
They're paying big bucks
     Fm
It's part of a grand old scheme.
     Bb
They make a big batch in a shiny new place
    Cm
But man it just ain't the real thing.

(Verse 2-Paul)

Cm
They put it on trucks
Eb
Haul it away
Fm
stack it on a shelf in a store.
    Bb
but that ain't the way it's meant to be done
    Cm
and that ain't what it's made for.

(Chorus-everyone)

        Ab       Cm
I'm the last moonshiner
    Ab              Cm
the last of a dying kind
        Ab       Cm
I'm the last moonshiner
              Ab          Fm        Cm
I just wasn't made (pause)for these  times.

(Gary-Plays riff twice)

(Verse 3-Dan)

Cm
it's got a strange name.
Eb
it doesn't taste right.
       Fm
wasn't made in the cool mountain air.
Bb
the water didn't come from a spring in the woods
           Cm
but from a tap in a city somewhere.

(Verse 4-Paul)

Cm
I make it the way
Eb
it's supposed to be made.
          Fm
I ain't a running around with these clowns.
Bb
Some things can't be bought or sold
        Cm
and you can't water everything down.

(Chorus-everyone)

        Ab       Cm
I'm the last moonshiner
    Ab              Cm
the last of a dying kind
        Ab       Cm
I'm the last moonshiner
              Ab           Fm        Cm
I just wasn't made (pause) for these times.

(Gary-Plays riff twice)

(Key change to C#m)

(Verse 5-Paulette)

Dbm
There's a big city lawyer
E
She's making sure
     Gbm
that all the taxes are paid.
B
I tell you now straight up and true
          Dbm
well it's just a disgrace to the trade.

(Verse 6-Dan)

Dbm
There's a billboard sign
         E
says the real moonshine.
       Gbm
let me tell you one thing if you will
B
you take the cash I'll take my pride
    Dbm
and head back up to the hills.

(Chorus-everyone)

        A        Dbm
I'm the last moonshiner
    A               Dbm
the last of a dying kind
        A        Dbm
I'm the last moonshiner
              A    Gbm       Dbm
I just wasn't made for these times.

        A        Dbm
I'm the last moonshiner
              A            Gbm       Dbm
I just wasn't made (pause) for these times.
