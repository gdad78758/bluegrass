(Intro Instrumental - Brian)

G                                 C
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
 D                    G
Where I wandered when I was a lad
                     C
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
  D                   G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away


(Verse 1 Paulette sings)
G                                 C
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
        D                    G
Where I wandered when I was a lad
                            C
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
         D                   G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away


(Chorus All sing)
                             C
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
           D                      G
From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam
                                    C
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
    D                               G
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home


(Instrument break 1)
G                                 C
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
 D                    G
 Where I wandered when I was a lad
                     C
 And I wandered alone to the place I call home
  D                   G
 In those Blue Ridge hills far away


(Verse 2 Paulette sings)
G                                   C
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
         D                   G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away
                              C
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
          D                        G
They are sleeping in peace together there


(Chorus All sing)
                             C
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
           D                     G
From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam
                                    C
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
     D                              G
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home


(Instrument break 2)
G                                 C
 There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
D                    G
Where I wandered when I was a lad
                     C
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
 D                   G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away


(Verse 3 Paulette sings)
G                          C
I return to that old cabin home with a sigh
          D                    G
I've been longing for days gone by
                                     C
When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side
         D                             G
Make my resting place upon the hills so high


(Chorus All sing)
                             C
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
           D                     G
From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam
                                    C
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
    D                               G
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home



(Instrument break 3)
G                                 C
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
D                     G
Where I wandered when I was a lad
                     C
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
D                   G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away



(Chorus All sing)
                             C
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
           D                     G
From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam
                                    C
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
    D                               G
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home

    D                               G
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home

(Larry plays doodley-do!)
