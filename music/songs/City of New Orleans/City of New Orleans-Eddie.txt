City of New Orleans (Steve Goodman)

Verse: [C] Riding on the [G] City of New [C] Orleans [/]  ([/] = another measure of the same chord)
[Am] Illinois central [F] Monday morning [C] rail [G]
[C] Fifteen cars and [G] fifteen restless [C] riders [/]
[Am] Three conductors and [G] twenty five sacks of [C] mail [/]

Bridge: [Am] All along the southbound [/] Odyssey [Em] The train pulls out of [/] Kankakee
[G] And rolls along the [/] houses, farms and [D] fields [/]
[Am] Passing towns that [/] have no name and [Em] freight yards full of [/] old black men
And the [G] graveyards of the [/] rusted automo- [C] biles [/]

Chorus: [F] Good morning [G] America how are [C] you  [/]
[Am] Say don't you know me [F] I'm your native [C] son [G] 
I'm the [C] train they call the [G] City of New [Am] Orleans [D]
I'll be [Bb] gone five [F] hundred [G] miles when the day is [C] done [/]

Verse: [C] Dealing cards with the [G] old men in the [C] club car [/]
[Am] Penny a point ain't [F] no one keeping [C] score [G]
[C] Pass the paper [G] bag that holds the [C] bottle [/]
[Am] Feel the wheels [G] grumbling neath the [C] floor [/]

Bridge: [Am] And the sons of Pullman [/] porters and the [Em] sons of  engi- [/] neers
Ride their [G] fathers' magic [/] carpet made of [D] steel [/]
[Am] Mothers with their [/] babes asleep [Em] rocking to the [/] gentle beat
[G] And the rhythm of the [/] rails is all they [C] feel [/] (REPEAT CHORUS)

Verse: [C] Nighttime on the [G] City of New [C] Orleans [/]
[Am] changing cars in [F] Memphis, Tennes- [C] see [G]
[C] Halfway home and [G] we'll be there by [C] morning [/]
Through the [Am] Mississippi darkness [G] rolling down to the [C] sea [/] 

Bridge: And [Am] all the towns and [/] people seem to [Em] fade into a [/] bad dream
And the [G] steel rail [/] still ain't heard the [D] news [/]
The [Am] conductor sings his [/] song again, the [Em] passengers will [/] please refrain
[G] This trains got the [/] disappearing railroad [C] blues [/] (REPEAT CHORUS)
