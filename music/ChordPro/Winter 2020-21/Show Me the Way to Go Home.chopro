{t: Show me the Way to go home}
{st: [jaws sea shanty] by Irving King}

[G]Show me the way to go [G7]home,
I'm [C]tired and I want to go to [G]bed,
Cos I had a little drink about an hour ago,
And it's [A7]gone right to me [D7]head,
No [G]matter where I roam,
On [C] land or sea or [B7]foam,
You will [G]always hear me singing this song,
[A7]Show me the [D7]way to go [G]home.
