[Am]   [F]   [D7]   [F]   [Am]   [F]  [D7]   [F]

[Am] There's a man who [Dm] leads a life of [Am] danger
To [Am] everyone he meets he stays a [E7] stranger
With [Am] every move he makes, a-[Dm]nother chance he takes
[Am] Odds are he won't [Dm] live to see to-[Am]morrow

Secret [Em] Agent [Am] Man, Secret [Em] Agent [Am] Man
They've [F] given you a [E7] number and taken away your [Am] name

[Am]   [F]   [D7]   [F]   [Am]   [F]  [D7]   [F]

[Am] Beware of pretty [Dm] faces that you [Am] find
A [Am] pretty face can hide an evil [E7] mind
Oh, be [Am] careful what you say, or you'll [Dm] give yourself away
[Am] Odds are you won't [Dm] live to see to-[Am]morrow

Secret [Em] Agent [Am] Man, Secret [Em] Agent [Am] Man
They've [F] given you a [E7] number and taken away your [Am] name

[Am]   [F]   [D7]   [F]   [Am]   [F]  [D7]   [F]

[Am] Swinging on the [Dm] Riviera [Am] one day
And then [Am] laying in a Bombay alley [E7] next day
Oh, don't you [Am] let the wrong words slip, [Dm] while kissing persuasive lips
[Am] Odds are you won't [Dm] live to see to-[Am]morrow
