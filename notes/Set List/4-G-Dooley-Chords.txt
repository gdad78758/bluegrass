Dooley - Key G
    | 1                 | 4               | 1                   | 5        | 
    Doo - ley  was a    good old man, he  lived be-low the      mill.
    One gal watched the boil-er, the      oth-er watched the    spout.
    | 1                 | 4               | 1      5            | 1        | repeat
    Doo - ley had two   daugh-ters and a  for-ty gal - lon      still.
    Ma- ma corked the   bot-tles when old Doo- ley fetched them out.
    Chorus
     | 1                 | 1               | 4                   | 4       |
       Dooley, Slippin' up the holler,       Dooley, tryin' to make a dollar.
     | 1                 | 1               | 5                   | 1       |
       Dooley, give me a swaller,            And I'll pay you back some day.
	Verse 2 
  The revenuers came for him, a slippin' through the woods.
  Dooley kept behind them all and never lost his goods.
  Dooley was a trader when into town he come,
  Sugar by the bushel and molasses by the ton.
  Verse 3
  I remember very well the day old Dooley died,
  The woman folk looked sorry, the men stood around and cried.
  Now Dooley's on the mountain, he lies there all alone,
  They put a jug beside him and a barrel for a stone.
