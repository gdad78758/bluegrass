(Intro Lick)

(Verse 1)
D
 Ridin' down 290, the fog was thick

I didn't see what happened, it happened so quick
G
 I felt a thump, I heard a squish
D
 I hit the brakes about went in the ditch
A
 Jumped out of my truck and to my surprise
D                              D
 (stop) A damned armadillo was  stuck to my tire

(Chorus)
G
 Well, ain't it the luck, it happens all the time
D
 Never seen one make it to the other side
E7
 The chicken will cross that road for fun
A                                  A
 (stop) To prove to the 'dilo that  it could be done


(Verse 2)
D
 If ever was a creature born with a jinx

It's a Texas armadillo, whenever he thinks
G
 "That road ain't so wide", "Hey, that truck ain't so fast"
D
 Well, that kinda thinking always ends in a splat
A
 It ain't their fault, they're made that way
D                                        D
 (stop) Persistent armadillos 'til their  dying day

(Verse 3)
D
 If your ridin' down any old Texas road

You see an armadillo walking on the shoulder
G
 It is true, as sure as you're born
D
 It'll do you no good, to try to blow your horn
A
 If he's got his mind to try to make it across
D                                     D
 (stop) He'll try just that no matter  what the cost


(Chorus)
G
 Well, ain't it the luck, it happens all the time
D
 Never seen one make it to the other side
E7
 The chicken will cross that road for fun
A                                  A

A
 It ain't their fault, they're made that way...
