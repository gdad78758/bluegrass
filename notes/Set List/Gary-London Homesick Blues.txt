(Verse 1)
                  G
Well, when you’re down on your luck,
                             D
And you ain’t got a buck, in  London you’re a goner. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

     Am                D7
Even London Bridge has fallen down,
    G                              C
And  moved to Ari-zona, now I know  why. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And I’ll substantiate the rumor
                                    G
That the English sense of humor, is  drier than than the Texas sand. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
        Em                              D#
You can  put up your dukes, And you can  bet your boots;
    D
I’m  leavin’ just as fast as I can. (2,3,4, Stop)
 

(Chorus All sing)
 
           C              Em         Am
I wanna go  home with the  armadillo
             C               D             G
Good country  music from Ama-rillo and Abi-lene
                C                         D                  G
The friendliest  people and the prettiest  women you’ve ever  seen.


(Verse 2)
G
Well, it’s cold over here, and I swear
  D
I  wish they’d turn the heat on (2,3,4,1,2,3)

    Am                         D7
And where in the world is that English girl
  G                                       C
I  promised I would meet ... on the third  floor. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And of the whole damn lot, the only friend I’ve got
     G
Is a  smoke and a cheap guitar. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
   Em                      D#
My  mind keeps roamin’, my  heart keeps longin’
      D
To be  home in a Texas bar. (2,3,4, Stop)

(Chorus All sing)
 
           C              Em         Am
I wanna go  home with the  armadillo
             C               D             G
Good country  music from Ama-rillo and Abi-lene
                C                         D                  G
The friendliest  people and the prettiest  women you’ve ever  seen.(2,3,4,1,2,3)

(Lead Break - Gary)
 
           C              Em         Am
I wanna go  home with the  armadillo
             C               D             G
Good country  music from Ama-rillo and Abi-lene
                C                         D                  G
The friendliest  people and the prettiest  women you’ve ever  seen.(2,3,4,1,2,3)


(Verse 3)

G
Well, I decided that I’d get my cowboy hat
    D
And  go down to Marble Arch Station. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

              Am                   D7
’Cause when a Texan fancies, he’ll take his chances.
G                                  C
 Chances will be taken, that’s for  sure. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

And them Limey eyes, they were eyein’ the prize
          G
That some  people call manly footwear. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
              Em                           D#
And they said  you’re from down South, and  when you open your mouth,
    D
You  always seem to put your foot there. (2,3,4, Stop)


(Chorus All sing)
 
           C              Em         Am
I wanna go  home with the  armadillo
             C               D             G
Good country  music from Ama-rillo and Abi-lene
                C                         D                  G
The friendliest  people and the prettiest  women you’ve ever  seen. (2,3,4,1,2)


(Repeat chorus)

           C              Em         Am
I wanna go  home with the  armadillo
             C               D             G
Good country  music from Ama-rillo and Abi-lene
                C                         D                  G      G
The friendliest  people and the prettiest  women you’ve ever  seen.
