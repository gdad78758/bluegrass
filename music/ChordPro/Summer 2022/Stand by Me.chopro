(Intro:) 

[C]////    [C]////    [Am]////    [Am]////     [F]////    [G]////    [C]////    [C]////

When the [C]night has come   [Am]  and the land is dark
And the  [F]moon is the  [G]only light we'll  [C]see
No I [C]won't be afraid no I  [Am] won't be afraid
Just as   [F]long as you  [G]stand  stand by [C]me

[C] So darling darling stand by me oh  [Am] stand by me
Oh   [F]stand,  [G] stand by me, [C] stand by me

[C] If the sky that we look upon
[Am] Should tumble and fall
Or the  [F]mountain should  [G]crumble to the  [C]sea
I [C]won't cry I won't cry no I  [Am] won't shed a tear
Just as  [F]long as you  [G]stand, stand by  [C]me

[C] And darling darling stand by me oh  [Am] stand by me
Oh  [F]stand,  [G] stand by me, [C] stand by me
