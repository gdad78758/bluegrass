 G      Well, when you're down on your luck,
 D      And you ain't got a buck, in London you're a goner. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
 Am D7  Even London Bridge has fallen down,
 G  C   And moved to Ari-zona, now I know why. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

 C      And I'll substantiate the rumor
 C  G   That the English sense of humor, is drier than than the Texas sand. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
 Em Cm  You can put up your dukes, And you can bet your boots; 
 D      I'm leavin' just as fast as I can. (2,3,4,1,2)

Larry sings Verse 2
  G      Well, it's cold over here, and I swear
  D      wish they'd turn the heat on (2,3,4,1,2,3)
  Am D7  And where in the world is that English girl
  G C    I promised I would meet ... on the third floor. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

  C      And of the whole damn lot, the only friend I've got
  G      Is a smoke and a cheap guitar. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
  Em Cm  My mind keeps roamin', my heart keeps longin' 
  D      home in a Texas bar. (2,3,4,1,2)

Paulette sings Verse 3

  G      Well, I decided that I'd get my cowboy hat
  D      And go down to Marble Arch Station. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
  Am D7  'Cause when a Texan fancies, he'll take his chances.
  G C    Chances will be taken, that's for sure. (2,3,4,1,2,3)

  C      And them Limey eyes, they were eyein' the prize
  G      That some people call manly footwear. (2,3,4,1,2,3)
  Em Cm  And they said you're from down South, and when you open your mouth, 
  D      You always seem to put your foot there. (2,3,4,1,2)
