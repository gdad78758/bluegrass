Brian starts - one verse

Paulette sings Verse 1
              1        3-7         4         1
    It's been ten long years since I left my home
                              5
    In the holler where I was born
              1         3-7             4          1
    Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
                       5         1
    And the fox hunter blows his horn

Paulette sings Verse 2
    1  3-7 4 1  I fell in love with a girl from the town
    1  5        I thought that she would be true
    1  3-7 4 1  I ran away to Charlottesville 
    1  5  1     And worked in a sawmill or two

     What have they done to the old home place?
	 2-7                  5-7
     Why did they tear it down?
	     1         3-7      4           1   
     And why did I leave my plow in the field?
	                5          1
     And look for a job in the town?

Paulette sings Verse 3
    1  3-7 4 1  Well, the girl ran off with somebody [G]else
    1  5        The taverns took all my pay
    1  3-7 4 1  And here I stand where the old home stood
    1  5  1     Before they took it away
 
Paulette sings Verse 4 
    1  3-7 4 1  Now the geese fly south and the cold wind blows
    1  5        As I stand here and hang my head
    1  3-7 4 1  I've lost my love, I've lost my home
    1  5  1     And now I wish that I was dead
