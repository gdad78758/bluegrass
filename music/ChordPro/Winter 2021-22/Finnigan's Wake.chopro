Now you see he'd a sort of a [Em] tipp' lin' way
With a [G] love of  liquor,  [Em] Tim was born
And to [G] help him on with his [Em] way each day
He'd a [C] drop of the craythur [D7] every [G] morn

And they [G] carried him home his [C] corpse to [G] wake
They rolled him up in a [Em] nice clean sheet
And [G] laid him out u-[Em]-pon the bed
With a [G] gallon of whiskey [Em] at his feet
And a [C] barrel of porter [D7] at his [G] head

Biddy O'Brien be-[Em]-gan to cry

And [G] left her sprawling [C] on the [G] floor
Each side in war did [Em] soon engage
