[D]////  [D]////  [D]////  [D]////

[D] Grandma got run over by a reindeer
walking home from our house Christmas [G] Eve
[G] You can say there's no such thing as [D] Santa
but [A] as for me and grandpa we be-[D]lieve [C] [G] [D-stop]
 
She'd been drinking too much [A] egg nog
and we begged her not to [D] go
but she forgot her medi-[G]cation
and she [A] wandered out the door into the [D] snow
 
[Bm] When we found her Christmas [A] morning
at the scene of the  a[D]-ttack
there were hoofprints on her [G] forehead
and in [A]-criminating claw marks on her [D] back

walking home from our house Christmas [G] Eve
[G] You can say there's no such thing as [D] Santa
but [A] as for me and grandpa we be-[D]lieve [C] [G] [D-stop]
 
Now weâ€™re all so proud of [A] grandpa
he's been taking this so [D] well
see him in there watching [G] football
drinking [A] beer and playing cards with cousin [D] Mel
 
[Bm] It's not Christmas without [A] grandma
all the familys dressed in [D] black
and we just cant help but [G] wonder
should we [A] open up her gifts or send them [D] back !

Now the goose is on the [A] table
and the pudding made of [D] fig
and the blue and silver [G] candles
that would [A] just have matched the hair in grandmas [D] wig
 
[Bm] I've warned my friends and [A] neighbors
better watch out for your [D] selves
they should never give a [G] license
to a [A] man who drives a sleigh and plays with [D] elves!
