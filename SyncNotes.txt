How to sync everything:

- Make any changes in the bluegrass/links and bluegrass/music folders
- Add everything you don't want to be followed by git to the SyncWithMartyOffice folder
  on the Marty-Office computer
- Keep track of anything you delete from the SyncWithMartyOffice folder because you'll 
  have to delete them manually on the RPi
- use Visual Studio Code and make sure everything is up to date
- invoke syncblue.sh  - on the Marty-Office computer, use the windows ubuntu app which
                        will give you a linux like terminal on the windows machine.
						Then cd /mnt/c/git
						Then invoke the update script:   ./syncblue.sh
- This takes everything on the Marty-Office computer sends it to the RPi


- To update the RPi computer (69.5.217.253):
        - ssh into it:   ssh -p 2622 marty@192.171.200.177
		*** Look in the SyncWithMartyOffice folder and fix it up to conform to       ***
		*** Marty-Office computer's /mnt/c/git/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice folder. ***
		*** You will have to manually removed and reorganize anything that's wrong   ***

		*** You will also have to update the folder /var/www/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice ***
		- Now within the home folder /home/marty invoke the shell script
			./update_bluegrass.sh
		- Log out of the RPi computer - exit

				Choose 'SyncLinuxDesktop'
					On left side choose c:\git\bluegrass\SyncWithMartyOffice
					On right side choose 
					ftp://marty@192.168.1.237/home/marty/git/bluegrass/SyncWithMartyOffice|pass64=Y2hpY28=
            	Do a 'Compare', then 'Synchronize'
