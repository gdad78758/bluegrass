Well,  I pulled out of Austin
A
 Headed up to Boston
B                              E
 Friday night I'll head for Alabam

     E
Everytime I see an exit
A
 It makes me think of Texas
B                                 E
 Makes me want to turn this thing  around.

       E
Did my  time in Amarillo
A
 The land of the armadillo
B                                   E
 Old Bob Wills is still the king to  me

       E
When I  hear my favorite Song
          A
bout that  rose of San Antone
              B                    E
you know it -  feels like texas to  me

A                    E
 Feels like texas to  me.
                                B
Ain't no other place I'd rather  be.
   E
No  matter where I'm at,
       A
when I  see a cowboy hat,
B                    E
 feels like texas to  me

         E
Well I'm  west bound and down
         A
and I've  got this sucker wound
B                              E
 boys I'm passing everything I  see

         E
Out here  on this interstate
       A
I just  play a little Strait
B                    E
 Feels like Texas to  me

A                    E
 Feels like texas to  me.
                                B
Ain't no other place I'd rather  be.
   E
No  matter where I'm at,
       A
when I  see a cowboy hat,
B                    E
 feels like texas to  me

       E
When I  leave the lonestar state
         A
and walk  through those pearly gates
I know it's gonna
B                   E
 Feel like Texas to  me
