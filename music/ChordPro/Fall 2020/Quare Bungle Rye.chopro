{t: Quare Bungle Rye}
{st: Traditional,  (performed by The Dubliners)}

[C] Now Jack was a sailor who roamed on the [C7]  town
And he [F] met with a [C] damsel who [G7] skipped up and down
Said the [C] damsel to Jack as she passed him [C7] by,
"Would you [F] care for to [C]  purchase some  
[F] Quare Bungle [C] Rye, roddy [G7] rye?
Fol the diddle rye roddy rye roddy [C] rye"

[C] Thought Jack to himself, "Now what can this [C7] be?
But the [F] finest of [C]  whiskey from [G7]  far Germany
Smuggled [C]  up in a basket and sold on the [C7] sly
And the [F] name that it [C] goes by is
[F] Quare Bungle [C] Rye, roddy [G7] rye?
Fol the diddle rye roddy rye roddy [C] rye"
