[Em] On a dark desert highway [B7] cool wind in my hair
[D] Warm smell of colitas [A] rising up through the air
[C] Up ahead in the distance [G] I saw a shimmering light
[Am] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[B7] I had to stop for the night

[Em] There she stood in the doorway [B7] I heard the mission bell
[D] And I was thinking to myself this could be [A] heaven or this could be hell
[C] Then she lit up a candle [G] and she showed me the way
[Am] There were voices down the corridor [B7] I thought I heard them say

[D] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [A] that she calls friends
[C] How they dance in the courtyard [G] sweet summer sweat
[Am] Some dance to remember [B7] some dance to forget

[Em] So I called up the captain [B7] please bring me my wine
He said [D] we haven't had that spirit here since [A] nineteen sixty-nine
[C] And still those voices are calling from [G] far away
[Am] Wake you up in the middle of the night [B7] just to hear them say

[Em] Mirrors on the ceiling [B7] the pink champagne on ice
And she said [D] we are all just prisoners here [A] of our own device
[C] And in the master's chambers [G] they gathered for the feast
[Am] They stab it with their steely knives but they [B7] just can't kill the beast

Final chord: [Em]



On a dark desert highway cool whip in my hair
Warm smell of fajitas rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My stomach growled and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for a bite

There she stood in the doorway I smell the Taco Bell
And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell
then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the fast food Mexicana
Such a lovely place for your diet disgrace
Plenty of choice at the fast food Mexicana
