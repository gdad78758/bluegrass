[Bm] Well I was over in Motel 5 with Suzie Sour
I was [E] having a smoke, Suzie was takin a [Bm] shower
Then I [E] heard my wife at the door...
"Come [Bm] out, I know you're [E] in there [Bm] George..."
well I was [F#] caught and I didn't know what to [Bm] do. [F#m]

So I [Bm] went to the back and [F#m] jumped throught the bathroom [Bm] window...
I [E] started runnin'... where to, I still [Bm] didn't know....
Then I [E] heard a little 'pop'
I was [Bm] hit but I didn't [E] drop...
I [F#m] thought I was dyin' but I've never seen me [Bm] bleed in blue...

[B] Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!
Brought me down when I was [E] tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were a [F#] bout to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a [Bm] paintball gun!

[Bm]       | [E]     | [F#m]    | [Bm]     | [E]        | [F#]     | 
[Bm] [F#m] | [Bm]    | [E]      | [F#m]    | [Bm] [F#m] |

Well I [Bm] zigged and I zagged and I [F#] finally found my place to [F#] duck...
Then that [E] crazy woman... she started shootin' at my [Bm] truck...
Now... it [E] looks like a modern art...
And I'm [B] sore in some important [E] parts
So [Bm] before you run a [F#m] round boys remember what happened to [Bm] me...

Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!
Brought me down when I was [E] tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were a [F#] bout to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a [Bm] paintball gun!

Well.... she got me with a paintball gun
Brought me down when I was [E] tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were a [F#] bout to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a [Bm] paintball gun!
