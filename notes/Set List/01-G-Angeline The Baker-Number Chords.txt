(Intro - Instrumental)
Angeline the Baker, lives on the village green;
And the way that I love Angeline, beats all I've ever seen.

(Verse-1 Paulette sings)
Angeline the Baker, lives on the village green;
And the way that I love Angeline, beats all I've ever seen.
Angeline the Baker, Angeline I know,
I should've married Angeline twenty years ago.

(Chorus All sing)
Angeline the Baker, age of forty-three
Fed her sugar candy, still won't marry me.
Angeline the Baker, Angeline I know,
Should've married Angeline twenty years ago.

(Instrumental Break 1)

(Verse-2 Paulette sings)
Her father was a baker, his name was Uncle Sam;
And I remember Angeline, no matter where I am.
She said she couldn't do hard work because she was not stout;
She made the biscuits ev'ry day and poured that coffee out.

(Chorus All sing)

(Instrumental Break 2)

(Verse-3 Paulette sings)
I bought Angeline a brand new dress, was neither black nor brown;
It was the color of the sky before the rain came down.
Sixteen horses in my pack, the leader he was blind;
I dreamt I was dyin, so I'd see my Angeline.

(Chorus All sing)

(Instrumental Break 3)

(Chorus All sing)

(Verse-3 Repeat Paulette sings)
I bought Angeline a brand new dress, was neither black nor brown;
It was the color of the sky before the rain came down.
Sixteen horses in my pack, the leader he was blind;
I dreamt I was dyin, so I'd see my Angeline.

(Instrumental Break 4)

(Chorus - Outro All Sing)
Angeline the Baker, age of forty-three
I fed her sugar candy, and she still won't marry me.
Angeline the Baker, Angeline I know,
Yes, I should've married Angeline (slow down) twenty years ago.
