{t: Mr. Tambourine Man}

[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
I'm not [C] sleepy and there [F] ain’t no [Dm] place I'm [G] going to [G7]
[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
In the [C] jingle jangle [F] morning I'll come [G7] followin' [C] you


[F] Take me for a [G7] trip upon your [C] magic swirlin' [F] ship
All my [C] senses have been [F] stripped and my [C] hands can't feel to [F] grip
And my [C] toes too numb to [F] step
Wait [C] only for my [Dm] boot heels to be [G] wander[G7]in'
I'm [F] ready to go [G7] anywhere I'm [C] ready for to [F] fade
In[C]to my own pa[F]rade cast your [C] dancing spell my [F] way
I [Dm] promise to go [G] under [G7] it


[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
I'm not [C] sleepy and there [F] ain’t no [Dm] place I'm [G] going to [G7]
[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
In the [C] jingle jangle [F] morning I'll come [G7] followin' [C] you

Then [F] take me disa-[G7]ppearing through the [C] smoke rings of my [F] mind,
Down the [C] foggy ruins of [F] time, far [C] past the frozen [F] leaves,
The [C] haunted, frightened [F]trees, out [C] to the windy [F] beach,
Far [C] from the twisted [Dm] reach of crazy [G7] sorrow.
Yes, to [F] dance beneath the [G7] diamond sky with [C] one hand waving [F] free,
Silhou-[C]etted by the [F] sea, circled [C] by the circus [F] sands,
With all [C] memory and [F] fate driven [C] deep beneath the [F] waves,
Let me for-[C]get about [F] today until to-[G7]morrow.

[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
I'm not [C] sleepy and there [F] ain’t no [Dm] place I'm [G] going to [G7]
[F] Hey Mr [G7] Tambourine Man [C] play a song for [F] me
In the [C] jingle jangle [F] morning I'll come [G7] followin' [C] you
