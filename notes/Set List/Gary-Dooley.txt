Dooley, Slippin' up the holler,       Dooley, tryin' to make a dollar.
G                 G                   D                     G
Dooley, give me a swaller,            And I'll pay you back some day.


(Verse 2 Larry sings)

G             C               G                    D
The revenuers came for him, a slippin' through the woods.
G             C                 G     D        G
Dooley kept behind them all and never lost his goods.

Dooley was a trader when into town he come,
G            C          G        D      G
Sugar by the bushel and molasses by the ton.

I remember very well the day old Dooley died,
G              C                 G         D          G
The woman folk looked sorry, the men stood around and cried.
G            C                   G              D
Now Dooley's on the mountain, he lies there all alone,
G              C                G      D     G
They put a jug beside him and a barrel for a stone.
