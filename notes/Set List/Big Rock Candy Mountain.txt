[Intro]
        C
One evening as the sun went down
               G7         C
And the jungle fires were burning,
          C
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
                    G7      C
And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
    F                        F
I'm headed for a land that's far away
  F    C/E Dm  C   G7
Beside the crystal fountains
   C
So come with me, we'll go and see
             G7    C
The Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
[Verse 1]
       C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
          F                    C
There's a land that's fair and bright,
          F                C
Where the handouts grow on bushes
        F     C/E Dm C  G7
And you sleep out every night.
          C
Where the boxcars all are empty
        F                C
And the sun shines every day
        F             C
And the birds and the bees
        F         C
And the cigarette trees and the
    F        C
The lemonade springs
          F        C
Where the bluebird sings
       C              G7/B C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
 
[Verse 2]
       C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
        F                C
All the cops have wooden legs
        F                 C
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
        F    C/E Dm   C      G7
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
    C
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
        F                 C
And the barns are full of hay
       F        C
Oh I'm bound to go
            F        C
Where there ain't no snow
          F          C
Where the rain don't fall
    F           C
The winds don't blow
       C              G7/B C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
 
[Verse 3]
       C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
    F                 C
You never change your socks
        F                 C
And the little streams of alcohol
     F    C/E  Dm   C   G7
Come trickling down the rocks
    C
The brakemen have to tip their hats
        F                 C
And the railway bulls are blind
          F       C
There's a lake of stew
       F       C
And of whiskey too
        F          C
You can paddle all around it
     F      C
In a big canoe
       C              G7/B C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
[Verse 4]
       C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
    F                 C
The jails are made of tin.
    F                  C
And you can walk right out again,
   F    C/E Dm C   G7
As soon as you are in.
      C
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
   F              C
No axes, saws nor picks,
    F        C
I'm bound to stay
          F         C
Where you sleep all day,
           F        C
Where they hung the jerk
     F        C
That invented work
       C              G7/B C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
 
[Outro]
     F       C        F     C
I'll see you all this coming fall
       C              G7/B C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
