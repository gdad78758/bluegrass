(Verse 1 Dan sings)
G                  B7          C         G
It's been ten long years since I left my home
                          D
In the hollow where I was born
G                   B7              C          G
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
                  D         G
And the foxhunter blows his horn

(Instrumental break 1 - Larry & Gary)

G                  B7          C         G
It's been ten long years since I left my home
                   D
 In the hollow where I was born
G                   B7              C          G
 Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
           D         G
 And the foxhunter blows his horn


(Verse 2 Dan sings)
G         B7          C             G
I fell in love with a girl from the town
                            D
I thought that she would be true
  G   B7      C         G
I ran away to Charlottesville
                D          G
And worked in a sawmill or two

(Chorus All sing)
D                          G
What have they done to the old home place
A7                   D
Why did they tear it down
    G         B7        C           G
And why did I leave the plow in the field
               D          G
And look for a job in the town


(Instrumental break 2 - Brian & Marty)

G                  B7          C         G
It's been ten long years since I left my home
                   D
 In the hollow where I was born
G                   B7              C          G
 Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
           D         G
 And the foxhunter blows his horn


(Verse 3 Dan sings)
G                    B7       C        G
Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
                        D
The taverns took all my pay
    G      B7              C        G
And here I stand where the old home stood
            D       G
Before they took it away


(Instrumental break)

G                  B7          C         G
It's been ten long years since I left my home
                   D
 In the hollow where I was born
G                   B7              C          G
 Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
           D         G
 And the foxhunter blows his horn


(Verse 4 Dan sings)
G                      B7            C         G
Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
                            D
As I stand here and hang my head
     G       B7        C       G
I've lost my love I've lost my home
          D               G
And now I wish that I was dead


(Chorus All sing)
D                          G
What have they done to the old home place
A7                   D
Why did they tear it down
    G         B7        C           G
And why did I leave the plow in the field
               D          G
And look for a job in the town


(Outro)
               D          G
And look for a job in the town
