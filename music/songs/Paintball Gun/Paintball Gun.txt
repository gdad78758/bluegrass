Paintball Gun - Ashby Frank

Well I was over in Motel 5 with Suzie Sour
I was having a smoke, Suzie was takin a shower
Then I heard my wife at the door...
"Come out, I know you're in there George..."
well I was caught and I didn't know what to do.

So I went to the back and jumped throught the bathroom window...
I started runnin'... where to, I still didn't know....
Then I heard a little 'pop'
I was hit but I didn't drop...
I thought I was dyin' but I've never seen me bleed in blue...

Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!
Brought me down when I was tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were about to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!

Instrumental

Well I zigged and I zagged and I finally found my place to duck...
Then that crazy woman... she started shootin' at my truck...
Now... it looks like a modern art...
And I'm sore in some important parts
So before you run around won't you remember what happened to me...

Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!
Brought me down when I was tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were about to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!

Well.... she shot me with a paintball gun
Brought me down when I was tryin' to run!
Me and Suzie were about to have fun...
Shirley shot me with a paintball gun!
